					<h2>Question #1</h2>
					<br>
					<p>What is the price of college at a specific institution and how has it changed?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<h2>Data Source #1</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</p>
					<p><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/" target = "_blank">https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>IPEDS data are also available in slightly more user-friendly data in <a href = "https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/">College Navigator</a>, and fewer details are provided in the White House's <a href = "https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/higher-education/college-score-card">College Scorecard</a>.

						<h2>Pitfall #1</h2>
						<br>
						<h3>Sticker price vs. Net price</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Both can be manipulated by colleges through the books and supplies and living expenses elements of Cost of Attendance.<br>This is particularly a concern for students living off-campus.</p>

						<small>Source: Braden J. Hosch, SUNY Stony Brook</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Sticker price</h2>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Few people pay it, unless they are high-income and paying full freight or low income and didn't fill out the FAFSA (a significant group)</li>
							<li>For public institutions, beware of differences between in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Net price</h2>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>“Average net price” is deceiving because it doesn’t track people who actually do pay sticker price</li>
							<li>Only tracks students during their first year of college</li>
							<li>“Net Price by Income” can be affected by <a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/Are-Poor-Families-Really/148001/" target = "_blank">differences</a> between FAFSA and PROFILE measures of income for more-selective colleges</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data Source #1.5</h2>
						<p>Tuition Tracker (from EWA)</p>
						<a href = "http://www.tuitiontracker.org/" target = "_blank"><img src = "img/tuitiontracker.jpg" height = "350"></a>
						<p><a href = "http://www.tuitiontracker.org/" target = "_blank">www.tuitiontracker.org</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Shows net price and sticker price over time in an easy-to-read chart</li>
							<li>Has data for 4,000 two-year and four-year institutions</li>
							<li>Can download a full spreadsheet that's easier to read than IPEDS</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Data only go back five years</li>
							<li>Limited by what is available from IPEDS: No net price data for students who don't file a FAFSA</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Question #2:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>How accessible is a specific college to low-income students?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data Source #2:</h2>
						<br>
						<p>College Results Online (from The Education Trust)</p>
						<br>
						<a href = "http://www.collegeresults.org/" target = "_blank">www.collegeresults.org</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Lots of information, including Pell Grant %, Graduation rates by race, endowment, etc.</li>
							<li>Easy to compare to similar colleges</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Cons:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Can't download data or create your own spreadsheet</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pitfall #2:</h2>
					<p>Pell percent is an imperfect measure of access</p>
					<ul>
						<li>About 2 million students who would have qualified for a Pell Grant didn't file a FAFSA in 2011-12</li><small><em>(Source: Mark Kantrowitz)</em></small>
						<li>Some particularly wealthy institutions might provide institutional aid for low-income students who aren't receiving Pell Grants</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Still, it's the best we have and the most commonly used.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Question #3:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>How much do students take out in loans to pay for college?<p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data source #3:</h2>
						<br>
						<p>College InSight (from The Institute for College Access and Success)</p>
						<br>
						<p><a href = "http://college-insight.org/#spotlight/go" target = "_blank">www.college-insight.org</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pros:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Lots of financial aid figures, including average debt at graduations</li>
							<li>Ability to compare two institutions or an institutions to state/national sector</li>
							<li>Can download into Excel</li>
						</ul>	
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Cons:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Many students and institutions are excluded, included those who don't graduate and who attend two-year colleges</li>
							<li>Common Data Set data are self-reported by instutitions</li>
							<li>Most for-profits are excluded</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pitfall #3:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>When talking about debt and loans, know what the data say and what they don't say</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All undergraduates or just first-time, full-time freshman?</li>
						<li>Average amount borrowed or average debt at graduation?</li>
						<li>Federal loans or all loans? Subsidized or unsubsidized?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Question #4:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>How many of each type of federal loan and grant were given at a particular institution in a given timeframe?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Data source #4:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Title IV Program Volume Reports (from Federal Student Aid)</p>
					<p><a href = "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/title-iv" target = "_blank">studentaid.ed.gov/sa/data-center</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>Data on federal grants by program and year, released quarterly</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pitfall #4:</h2>
					<p>Number of loans does not equal number of borrowers. Some borrowers take out more that one type of loan.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Cautionary note:</h3> 
					<p>Some institutions report at the system level (i.e. Rutgers, U. of Phoenix)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Question #5:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>What are the national trends in college costs and financial aid?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data source #5:</h2>
						<br>
						<p>The College Board Reports</p>
						<p><a href = "http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing" target = "_blank">Trends in College Pricing</a></p>
						<p><a href = "http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid" target = "_blank">Trends in Student Aid</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Detailed trend data on college pricing and how students/families are paying for college</li>
							<li>Graphs and tables are user-friendly</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>They use net tuition, fees, room, and board&mdash;leaving out other expenses and books/supplies&mdash;so this is not the same as the federal definition of net price</li>
							<li>Definition of net price also includes tax credits, which many students don't get</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Pitfall #5:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Don't compare a single instutition's net price to the College Board's averages</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Question #6:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>How much student loan debt are Americans carrying and how does it compare to other types of debt?<p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data source #6:</h2>
						<br>
						<p>Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit (from Federal Reserve Bank of New York)<p>
						<p><a href = "http://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html" target = "_blank">www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Very current look at how much student loan debt is outstanding</li>
							<li>Combines private and federal loans</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pitfall #6:</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Total student loan debt includes that held by people for themselves and that held by parents for their children.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Some story ideas:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Federal work study: How many students get it? What types of jobs do they actually do?</li>
						<li>What percent of your local/state's public university's budget comes from government funding vs. tuition? How has that changed?</li>
						<li>How do different colleges in your city calculate living and other expenses as part of Cost of Attendance?</li>
						<li>Hidden fees that get tacked on to tuition</li>
					</ul>

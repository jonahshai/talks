						What makes this good data journalism? <br> She wasn't getting the data she wanted from Wisconsin, so she went to every other state and asked for the same data. Until a few days before they published, they had a sentence that said &quot;23 states gave us data. Wisc. wasn't one of them.&quot;

						<aside class="notes">
							FOIA can be a great tool. In part, as Jack Gillum says, &quot;This is your right as a citizen.&quot; <br> It is also an important tool for you as a journalist. <br> It takes time. Be patient. Know the FOIA Law.

						<h3>Fight back if you don't get what you ask for.</h3>
						<img src = "img/afewgoodmen.gif">
						<aside class="notes">
							Agencies are often relying both on your ignorance of your rights under the law and that you won't fight back. Prove them wrong. Story about Title IX here. Also, know the limits of the law and don't ask for too much. Try to talk directly to the people who know the data.

							If something doesn't look right, it's probably not.<br>Also, there are lots of things wrong with this: The photo. Didn't take it down when it turned out it was wrong.

						<span class = "fragment"><img src = "img/loudcities.png"></a></span>

							This is a map put out recently by [Whom?] showing the loudest places in the U.S. It was quickly picked up by several news outlets, including Vox.<br>What does this look like to you?

						<h3>Pitfall 3: Correlation is not causation</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							This site is obviously a joke to drive the point home, but you'd be surprised how often news organizations fall for this, especially when reporting on academic studies. NPR's Shanker Vidantem is often guilty of this.

					<h2>5. Don't be intimidated. Learn how to learn.</h2>
					<img src = "img/bartcover.png"></a>
					<aside class="notes">
						When I asked people for the advice that I should give you guys, this is what my former boss, Josh Hatch, tweeted back at me. <br> He's right, if you're not always learning new things, you're not going to get very far. Data reporting can be difficult--don't let that stop you.

					<h2>6. To learn a new skill, find a project.</h2>
					<img src = "img/baby.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is what I look like when I try to code. Not every journalist has to code. But if you are going to learn a new skill, do it with a project in mind.

					<h2>7. Any story can be a data story.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					<h2 class = "fragment">...And it probably should be.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Think of a story that you want to work on. It will almost always be improved with data. Alternatively, think of a dataset that you think is interesting. There's probably a story in it.<br>What are some stories that you guys want to look at? What data sources could you use?

						<h2>8. Use it for good, never for evil.</h2>
						<img src = "img/dr-evil.gif" class = "stretch">
						<aside class="notes">
							IPUMS mantra. You always hear "with great power comes great responsibility." That's how I see data journalism. Knowing how to use data also means knowing how to misuse it. Make sure you're not doing that.

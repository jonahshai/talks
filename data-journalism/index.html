						Why I'm here: Your professors asked me to come to talk with you about data journalism, what it is, why it is important, and how to use it in your career (and why I think you should).

					<h2>What is data journalism?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><p class = "fragment">My proposed definition: Journalism that relies in a significant way on new analysis of data or putting existing data in context</p></li>
							<li><p class = "fragment">Data can come at any stage in the process</p></li>
							<li><p class = "fragment">Data does not just mean numbers</p></li>
						</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Should be an easy question, right? It's not. There's no simple or agreed-upon definition. The distinction between data journalism and "regular" journalism is becoming less and less clear cut.

						What makes this good data journalism? <br> She wasn't getting the data she wanted from Wisconsin, so she went to every other state and asked for the same data. Until a few days before they published, they had a sentence that said &quot;23 states gave us data. Wisc. wasn't one of them.&quot;

						<h2>2. FOIA Early &amp; FOIA Often.</h2>
						<img src = "img/foia.gif" class = "stretch"></a>
						<aside class="notes">
							FOIA can be a great tool. In part, as Jack Gillum says, &quot;This is your right as a citizen.&quot; <br> It is also an important tool for you as a journalist. <br> It takes time. Be patient. Know the FOIA Law.
						</aside>

						<h3>Fight back if you don't get what you ask for.</h3>
						<img src = "img/afewgoodmen.gif">
						<p>Know the FOIA <a href = "http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=85&ChapterID=2" target = "_blank">law</a>.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Agencies are often relying both on your ignorance of your rights under the law and that you won't fight back. Prove them wrong. Story about Title IX here. Also, know the limits of the law and don't ask for too much. Try to talk directly to the people who know the data.

						<h3>Other FOIA Tips</h3>

							For a story on police early intervention, I wanted to know how many people where in CPD's early intervention programs.

						<h2>3. Be skeptical. Remember, data can lie.</h2>

						<h3>Pitfall 1: <br><a href = "https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/distrust-your-data/" target = "_blank">Distrust your data</a></h3>
						<p class = "fragment"><a href = "http://www.vox.com/2014/4/21/5636040/whats-the-matter-with-kansas-and-porn" target = "_blank"><img src = "img/Vox_Porn.png"></a></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							If something doesn't look right, it's probably not.<br>In other words, be as skeptical of data as you would be of a human source. There are lots of other things wrong with this: The photo. Didn't take it down when it turned out it was wrong.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pitfall 2: <br>Maps often don't show you what you think they do</h2>
						<span class = "fragment"><img src = "img/theatlantic.png"></a><img src = "img/nerdwallet.png"></a></span>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is a map put out by nerdwallet, and picked up by the Atlantic.<br>What do you see here? In other words, your data is meaningless if you don't normalize it.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pitfall 3: Correlation is not causation</h3>
						<p class = "fragment"><img src = "img/spuriouscorrelation.png"></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							This site is obviously a joke to drive the point home, but you'd be surprised how often news organizations fall for this, especially when reporting on academic studies. NPR's Shanker Vidantem is often guilty of this.

					<h2>4. Don't be intimidated. Learn how to learn.</h2>
					<img src = "img/bartcover.png"></a>
					<aside class="notes">
						When I asked people for the advice that I should give you guys, this is what my former boss, Josh Hatch, tweeted back at me. <br> He's right, if you're not always learning new things, you're not going to get very far. Data reporting can be difficult--don't let that stop you.

						<h2>5. To learn a new skill, find a project.</h2>
						<img src = "img/baby.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							This is what I look like when I try to code. Not every journalist has to code. But if you are going to learn a new skill, do it with a project in mind.

						<h2>Coding can come in handy</h2>

						<h2>6. Join IRE. Go to NICAR. Get on the Listserv.</h2>
						<a href = "http://ire.org/" target = "_blank"><img src="img/IRElogo.png"></a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Amazing community. Scroll down to show the conference and get into the <em>why</em> of a career in data journalism.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>7. Any story can be a data story<br>
					<h2 class = "fragment">...And it probably should be.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Think of a story that you want to work on. It will almost always be improved with data. Alternatively, think of a dataset that you think is interesting. There's probably a story in it.<br>What are some stories that you guys want to look at? What data sources could you use?
					</aside>

						<h2>8. Use it for good, never for evil.</h2>
						<img src = "img/dr-evil.gif" class = "stretch">
						<aside class="notes">
							IPUMS mantra. You always hear "with great power comes great responsibility." That's how I see data journalism. Knowing how to use data also means knowing how to misuse it. Make sure you're not doing that.

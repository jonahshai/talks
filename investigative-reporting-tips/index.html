                        Introduce myself
                        <br>
                        Why I'm here: Going to talk about three stories or projects that each have different elements of investigative reporting. Since I'm now an editor, I'm going to mostly use work I did at the Chicago Reporter. Feel free to ask questions as we're going through--but I also want to save significant time at the end for questions.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            We knew that police misconduct was a problem. But we wanted to find a way to quantify it--and a way that was different from what had been done before.

                            <strong>Define your story ideas as questions, not statements:</strong> Instead of saying, I want to do a story about non-Latinx immigrants at the border. Say, How many border crossers last year came from non-Latinx countries and how has that changed over time? 
                            <strong>Tune your radar for opportunities to quantify:</strong> As you're reporting out a story, always be thinking about things you could quantify. Has some measure changed over time? Are there differences between one part of the country and another?

                        <aside class="notes">
                            There was no data yet on trends within police misconduct lawsuits. So we created our own database. That allowed us to find trends that hadn't been reported on before. For example, we found that 10 percent of cases involved children or minors.

                            Investigative reporting is about holding the powerful--people, institutions, systems--accountable. One of the best ways to do that is to find somewhere else that's doing it better. We found lots of cities that were analyzing police misconduct lawsuits to find the trends that Chicago was missing.

                        This was a story about a security company that had been hired by the owners of a subsidized apartment complex to "protect" the property. But was instead terrorizing the residents--and using taxpayer dollars to do it.
                        This is Sheena Godfrey, a mother I met who was so afraid of the guards she had basically moved to her boyfriends.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The story got started because I went to a meeting hosted by MTO. It was an opportunity for their residents living in HUD-subsidized housing to speak to a regional director of HUD. Was sitting there and suddenly women got up and started talking about private security guards with assault rifles. My ears perked up.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        I was introduced to Sheena, who you saw earlier, by another tenant who I had met at the community meeting and who had invited me to her apartment and invited over several other women. She was incredibly warm and open to talking. And then she ghosted me--stopped responding to texts and phone calls. But I kept trying. And eventually she answered. She was concerned the first woman, who had connected us, was close to the management company and didn't trust her. But we were able to connect and she was an important source.

                            The women had filed a lawsuit. But, it turned out, so had Ricky Martinez. His lawsuit was against Chicago Police, claiming discrimination based on religion. Ricky Martinez, it turned out, was also known as Zouheir Rahmani, a wannabe cop who had applied several times for several different departments.

                            FOIA can be a great tool. In part, as Jack Gillum says, &quot;This is your right as a citizen.&quot; <br> It is also an important tool for you as a journalist. <br> It takes time. Be patient. Know the FOIA Law.
